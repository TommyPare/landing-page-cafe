Landing Page Coffee Shop 

A little project with a landing project for a tea / cafe shop.

Used this little project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Course to get a grip of the web development basics again. Took around 3-4 hours to complete total as I had to adapt to how Flexbox and CSS in general treats some stuff, but redoing it now I'd get it done faster, so that's exactly what I was aiming for - get a feeling for it again.
